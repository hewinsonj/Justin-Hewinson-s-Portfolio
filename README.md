The application will consist of a backend API using Express and a client-side interface built mostly with React components. We will use MongoDB for to store data and our server will use mongoose to interact with the database.

## Technologies Used

    - Mongoose
    - axios

    - MongoDB

- Client Application

    - axios (primarily for calls to my own backend API)
